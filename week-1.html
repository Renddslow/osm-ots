          <h4>Luke 24:13-27</h4>
          <div class="r-stack">
            <p class="scripture fragment fade-in-then-out">
              And behold, on that very day two of them were going to a village
              named Emmaus, which was sixty stadia from Jerusalem. And they were
              talking with each other about all these things which had taken
              place. While they were talking and discussing, Jesus Himself
              approached and began traveling with them. But their eyes were kept
              from recognizing Him.
            </p>
            <p class="scripture fragment fade-in-then-out">
              And He said to them, ‚ÄúWhat are these words that you are exchanging
              with one another as you are walking?‚Äù And they came to a stop,
              looking sad. One of them, named Cleopas, answered and said to Him,
              ‚ÄúAre You possibly the only one living near Jerusalem who does not
              know about the things that happened here in these days?‚Äù And He
              said to them, ‚ÄúWhat sort of things?‚Äù
            </p>
            <p class="scripture fragment fade-in-then-out">
              And they said to Him, ‚ÄúThose about Jesus the Nazarene, who proved
              to be a prophet mighty in deed and word in the sight of God and
              all the people, and how the chief priests and our rulers handed
              Him over to be sentenced to death, and crucified Him. But we were
              hoping that it was He who was going to <ins>redeem Israel</ins>.
              Indeed, besides all this, it is now the third day since these
              things happened. But also some women among us left us bewildered.
            </p>
            <p class="scripture fragment fade-in-then-out">
              When they were at the tomb early in the morning, and did not find
              His body, they came, saying that they had also seen a vision of
              angels who said that He was alive. And so some of those who were
              with us went to the tomb, and found it just exactly as the women
              also had said; but Him they did not see.‚Äù
            </p>
            <p class="scripture fragment fade-in-then-out">
              And then He said to them, ‚ÄúYou foolish men and slow of heart to
              believe in all that <ins>the prophets</ins> have spoken! Was it
              not necessary for the Christ to suffer these things and to come
              into His glory?‚Äù Then beginning with <ins>Moses</ins> and with all
              the <ins>Prophets</ins>, He explained to them
              <ins>the things written</ins> about Himself in all the Scriptures.

            tempted by the devil. And He ate nothing during those days, and when
            they had ended, He was hungry. And the devil said to Him, ‚ÄúIf You
            are the Son of God, tell this stone to become bread.‚Äù And Jesus
            answered him, ‚ÄúIt is written: ‚Äò<ins

            it to whomever I want. Therefore if You worship before me, it shall
            all be Yours.‚Äù Jesus replied to him, ‚ÄúIt is written: ‚Äò<ins

          <h3>Human &amp; Divine</h3>
          <p class="quote">
            While limited, a helpful metaphor for understanding this unified
            project may be found in the confession of the Church that Christ is
            both God and Man. We neither can confound his nature nor divide his
            personhood. Similarly, the Church confesses Christ as having two
            wills, one Divine and one human, yet both operated in full
            cooperation with one another, never being coerced or held hostage by
            one or the other. In a similar fashion, we may understand the
            cooperation of the Spirit and the human authors.
